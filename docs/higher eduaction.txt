Diplomas are short-term courses conducted by educational institutions and polytechnic colleges. If you have studied maths and science in classes nine and 10, you can write an entrance exam and join a diploma course in a polytechnic college in your state. A diploma is a three-year course designed for students of 10th or 10+2.

Once you complete your diploma, you can either take up a job or get admission for the second year directly through lateral entry in a BTech or BE course.
